                Hi there! My name is Kim Jong-un. I will be sharing my hobbies and interests. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro_paragraph2">
                Electronic dance music, or EDM, has always been a passion of mine. From the moment I first heard the pulsing beats and driving melodies, I knew that I wanted to be a part of this vibrant and constantly evolving genre. As a producer, I have always been drawn to the technical side of music creation. The endless possibilities offered by modern music software and hardware have allowed me to explore and experiment with different sounds and techniques, and I have always enjoyed the process of learning new skills and refining my craft. 
            </p>
            <P class="intro_paragraph2">
                In addition to my love of EDM, I have also always been fascinated by computers and technology. This interest led me to learn programming languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS, and I have enjoyed using these skills to work on web development projects in my free time. 
            </P>
            <P class="intro_paragraph2">
                When I'm not working on my music or coding projects, you can find me hanging out with friends and listening to all kinds of music. I believe that it's important to make time for the things and people that matter most, and I am grateful to have such a supportive group of friends and family to share my passions with. 
            </P>
            <P class="intro_paragraph2">
                Overall, my love of EDM and technology has shaped who I am and what I do. Whether I'm working on a new track, exploring new programming languages, or just enjoying the moment with loved ones, I am always striving to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way. 
            </P>
